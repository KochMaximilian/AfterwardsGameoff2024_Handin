  dialogue:
  - '<i>You gently spin the globe, its faded surface rough under your fingertips.

    </i>'
  - "<i>As you keep spinning, the continents seem to blur for a moment\u2014you tilt
    your head slightly, and so light catches on a piece of land you can\u2019t seem
    to recognize.\r</i>"
  - <i>You get lost in the thought of how this planet you call home has been through
    extinction so many times, and will do, forever.</i>
  - "<i>It feels like the Earth itself has been undone and built anew for eternity
    to this point. \r\n</i>"
  - "<i>You wish you could remember its very beginning\u2014you wonder if she has
    her own sort of amnesia too.</i>\r"
  - <i>What is this continent you just discovered? Is it missing its name too?</i>
  - <i>You want to embark on a journey to discover this brand new piece of land.
    </i>
  - <i>You feel like the whole {history} of the cosmos could be buried, patiently
    sedimented through aeons.</i>
