  dialogue:
  - "<i>There\u2019s a pale, ghostly girl, gently rocking on their feet.</i>"
  - "<i>You don\u2019t understand what\u2019s the deal with her, but she seems to
    be obsessively staring at the <color=#E9C002>plant</color>.</i>"
  - <i>She seems to be quite on a loop.</i>
  - <i>Her gaze appears to be tracing every curve of the stem, every minuscule imperfection,
    with a fervent focus that borders on reverence.</i>
