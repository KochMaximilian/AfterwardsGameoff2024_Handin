  dialogue:
  - <color=#C89768>You know, when I was your age, we had to dig a little deeper to
    figure things out. Nothing was handed to us on a silver platter.</color>
  - <color=#C89768>But there was something exciting about uncovering the truth bit
    by bit. </color>
  - <color=#C89768>Like peeling back the layers of an <color=#E9C002>old book</color>,
    you start to {see} the secrets buried {underneath}.</color>
  - <color=#C89768>Ah, your grandma always says I am too nosy. Always wanting to
    dig on things better left alone. </color>
  - "<color=#C89768>But hey, sometimes <color=#E9C002>secrets</color> just beg to
    be found, don\u2019t they?</color>"
  - '<color=#C89768>At the end of the day, honey, all we have to do is trust <color=#E9C002>His</color>
    plan. </color>

'
  - "<color=#C89768>We never really know what <color=#E9C002>He</color> has decided
    for us, and that\u2019s beautiful! To think I\u2019m in my seventies and still
    trying to figure out things!</color>\r\n"
  - "<color=#C89768>Some days I will just stare through that window and get lost
    in the unearthly glow of His light\u2026</color>\r\n"
