  dialogue:
  - <color=#C89768>A long, long time ago, two tiny little mammals lived by the woods.
    Their names were Fluflur and Rufluf.</color>
  - <color=#C89768>Although they were naturally independent animals, Flufur and Rufluf's
    paths crossed by chance on a full moon night, </color>
  - <color=#C89768>and ever since then, their bond was tied forever.</color>
  - '<color=#C89768>It was, as I said, a full moon night, round as a cheese. It looked
    so much like cheese that Flufur''s appetite was awakened, and he went out in
    search of some delicious snack.</color>


'
  - "<color=#C89768>\u2014 \"So hungry! Fluf, fluf. If only I had some cheese in
    my pantry... What a great tragedy, fluf!\"</color>\n"
  - '<color=#C89768>And so, Flurflur... I mean, Ruflur... Where was I again?</color>

'
  - '<color=#C89768>I''m afraid I can''t remember the rest, honey!</color>

'
  - '<color=#C89768>Will you excuse old grandpa Larry?</color>
