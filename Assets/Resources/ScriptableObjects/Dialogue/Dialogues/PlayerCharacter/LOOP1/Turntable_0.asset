  dialogue:
  - "This music\u2026 It\u2019s like you\u2019ve heard this piece before, yet you
    don\u2019t quite recall when or why\u2026 It feels like all the emotions you\u2019ve
    known during your life taking place at once. "
  - It pierces your very heart with solemn grief, as a shivering ray of hope tries
    to wipe your tears, powerless.
